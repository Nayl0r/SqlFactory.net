==============

SQL statement builder for .Net

SqlFactory provides a fluent API to take some of the effort out of manually building SQL strings. These string are based on the standard SQL language specification and so can be used by core System.Data objects to query and command the database, or by ORM frameworks to control the commands they send out.
